# kaggle-titanic-competition
This competition's goal is to correctly predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck considering other features.
You can find the dataset and relative information in this link:

# Project Planning
## Data Exploration
### 1) For numeric data 
* Made histograms to understand distributions 
* Corrplot 
* Pivot table comparing survival rate across numeric variables 


### 2) For Categorical Data 
* Bar charts to understand balance of classes 
* Pivot tables to understand relationship with survival 



* Histograms and boxplots 
* Value counts 
* Missing data 
* Correlation between the metrics 
## Explore interesting themes 
    # Wealthy survive? 
    # By location 
    # Age scatterplot with ticket price 
    # Young and wealthy Variable? 
    # Total spent? 
## Feature engineering 
* preprocess data together or use a transformer? 
    # use label for train and test   
* Scaling?

* Model Baseline 
* Model comparison with CV
